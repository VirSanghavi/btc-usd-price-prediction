## Frontend (Next.js)

A simple Next.js landing page with a live BTC/USD price ticker is available in `frontend/`.

### Quick start

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Build and run

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm start
```

This frontend is independent of the Python script. You can later wire it to an API that runs `btcrunner.py` if needed.
